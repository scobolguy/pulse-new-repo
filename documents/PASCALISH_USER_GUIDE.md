# Pascalish User Guide

## What Pascalish Is

Pascalish is a Pascal-style DSL used in this repository for routing/mapper and interop-oriented orchestration.

Common uses:
- define service/router/mapper logic
- describe queue routing and mapping behavior
- interoperate with WFL and COBOLISH documents

## File Type

- Extension: `.pas`
- Editor language id: `pascalish`

## Quick Start

Create a new Pascalish document using the develop workspace API:

```http
POST /api/develop/files
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "typeId": "pascalish"
}
```

## Minimal Example

```pascal
program "router-mapper-sample";
role code_librarian;
library "core-shared" from librarian;
interop wfl "payment-workflow" as wf;

var mt103Message : swift-mt103 from librarian;
```

## Compile Pascalish

```http
POST /api/develop/compile
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "fileName": "router-mapper-sample.pas",
  "mode": "compile"
}
```

Modes:
- `compile`
- `compile-run`
- `compile-debug`

## Interop Patterns

Typical interop declarations:

```pascal
interop wfl "payment-workflow" as wf;
interop cobolish "legacy-transform" as legacy;
```

## Best Practices

- keep declarations clear and top-level
- keep mapper/routing names stable for downstream references
- prefer small, testable units over one large source file
- compile after each significant change

## Troubleshooting

- If compile fails, verify file extension is `.pas` and mode is supported.
- If a referenced interop target is missing, ensure the target document exists in the develop workspace.
